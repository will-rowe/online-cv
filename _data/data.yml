career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm Will Rowe, a computational biologist working in microbial genomics.

      I write software to analyse metagenomic data.
      My main areas of interest are in identifying genetic
      variation within microbiomes using variation graphs,
      as well classifying microbiome samples using
      data sketching methods and machine learning.

experiences:
    - role: Computational biologist
      time: 2017 - Present
      company: UK Research and Innovation
      details: |
        Developing and implementing algorithms for the 
        analysis of genomic and metagenomic data.
        Projects include:
        - computational methods for microbiome classification tasks
        - identification of antibiotic resistance genes and mobile genetic elements
        - metagenomic pipeline development

    - role: Postdoctoral Research Associate
      time: 2016 - 2017
      company: University of Liverpool
      details: |
        Designing analysis pipelines, software and computational workflows 
        to analyse, visualise and store large-scale genomic and transcriptomic 
        data.

    - role: Trainee Clinical Scientist
      time: 2015 - 2016
      company: National Health Service
      details: |
        Utilising bioinformatics and genomic sequencing to facilitate the 
        identification of pathogenic variants in patient genome data.
