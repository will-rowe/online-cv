career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I'm Will Rowe, a computational biologist currently working in in the [Loman Lab](https://lab.loman.net/) on the 
    [ARTIC Network](http://artic.network/) and [COG-UK consortium](https://www.cogconsortium.uk/) projects.

    I work on algorithmic bioinformatics and genomics. I develop algorithms for a range of applications; 
    incorporating the latest advances in data sketching, machine learning and graph theory into my scientific 
    software and biological research portfolio. I apply my algorithmic work to biological problems, such as: 
    real-time genomic epidemiology of viral outbreaks, gene dynamics in the gut microbiome, and antimicrobial 
    resistance gene surveillance. 

    My future research strategy focusses on making large-scale genomic research accessible and tractable at 
    pace with advances in sequencing technologies; and applying this to global public health problems such 
    as antimicrobial resistance. This includes developing algorithms for indexing, augmenting and querying 
    genomic data collections using tiered computing infrastructure; ranging from low-cost laptops, phones 
    and chips, through to cloud and high-performance computing.

    I’m a strong proponent of open science and will continue to release open source software, teaching materials and research.
