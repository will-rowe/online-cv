career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I'm Will Rowe, a software engineer currently working at [GRAIL](https://grail.com/) in the UK engineering
    team. I mainly work on software for running our clinical trials but I also contribute to the 
    machine learning classifier and bioinformatics pipeline teams.

    I like to work on algorithmic bioinformatics and "big data" problems, developing algorithms for a range of applications and 
    incorporating the latest advances in data sketching, machine learning and graph theory into my 
    software and research portfolio. I apply my algorithmic work to biological problems, such as: 
    featurisation of genetic markers for population screening, real-time genomic epidemiology of viral outbreaks, 
    gene dynamics in the gut microbiome, and antimicrobial resistance gene surveillance.

          and research institutes (incl. Unilever, Rothamsted Research, Quadram 
          Institute) to deliver high performance computing solutions for 
          genomics applications. This resulted in several pieces of software being
